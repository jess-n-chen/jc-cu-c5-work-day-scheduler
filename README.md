## General Information

This repository contains the code for my calendar application powered by jQuery and Moment.js. It allows users to save events for each hour of the day. Starter Code was provided as is linked below.

## Project Requirements

User Story:

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

Acceptance Criteria:

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
